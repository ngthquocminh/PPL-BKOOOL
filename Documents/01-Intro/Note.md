# INTRODUCTION

## Implementation Methods

### Interpreter

- Virtual Machine: Java, Python, and C# are compiled to bytecode.

- Just-in-time compiler: C#, java, android

### Compiler

## Programing language type

### Interpreted language

- is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead read and executed by some other program (which normally is written in the language of the native machine). For example, the same "+" operation would be recognised by the interpreter at run time, which would then call its own "add(a,b)" function with the appropriate arguments, which would then execute the machine code "ADD" instruction. (python)

### Compiled language

- Where the program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine. For example, an addition "+" operation in your source code could be translated directly to the "ADD" instruction in machine code. (c++)

### Both

- Java, scala

### Note

- Dynamic language programming.
- Assembler: A program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations)
- Loader: Loading a program involves reading the contents of the executable file containing the program instructions into memory, and then carrying out other required preparatory tasks to prepare the executable for running.
- Debugger: un the target program under controlled conditions that permit the programmer to track its operations in progress and monitor changes in computer resources.
